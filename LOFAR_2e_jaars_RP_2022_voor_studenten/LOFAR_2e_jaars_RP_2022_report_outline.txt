Title:
- e.g., "LOFAR observations of a binary millisecond pulsar"

Abstract:
- 200 word description of the project and results

Introduction:
- Goal: give the necessary background and motivation

- 2-3 paragraphs about neutron stars and pulsars
- 1-2 paragraphs on millisecond pulsars (how are they formed?)
- 1 paragraph about what we can learn about/from pulsars
- 1 figure showing a pulsar (all figures should have captions)

Observations:
- Goal: describe the instrument and observational technique, as well as the data that was analysed

- 1 paragraph describing LOFAR
- 1 paragraph explaining how we can observe pulsars with LOFAR
- 1-2 paragraphs describing the observations you analysed
- 1 figure showing LOFAR
- 1 table summarising the observations

Analysis:
- Goal: describe the analysis that was done, but not yet the results thereof

- 2-3 paragraphs describing how you simulated pulsar data
- 2 paragraphs describing the analysis of PSR B1919+21 (single data set)
- 2-3 paragraphs describing the analysis of PSR J1810+1744 (multiple data sets)

Results:
- Goal: describe the results, but not yet the interpretation

- 1 paragraph describing the simulation results (and pointing to the relevant figures)
- 1 paragraph describing the PSR B1919+21 results (and pointing to the relevant figures)
- 2-3 paragraphs describing the PSR J1810+1744 results (including the mass determination)
- 2 figures showing pulsar simulations (timeseries and Fourier transform)
- 2 figures showing the PSR B1919+21 results (pulse stack and Fourier transform)
- 3 figures showing the PSR J1810+1744 results (Fourier transform, spin frequency vs. time and mass plot)

Discussion & Conclusions:
- Goal: explain what the results mean and summarise the paper

- 2-3 paragraphs comparing PSR J1810+1744 to other pulsars (consider spin rate, orbital period, companion mass, and eclipsing) - see: https://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/psrcat/
- 1 paragraph given a summary and prospects for other analyses that could be done
